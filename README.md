# CS101
Studies basic algorithms and their relationships to common abstract data types. Covers the notions of abstract data types and the distinction between an abstract data type and an implementation of that data type. The complexity analysis of common algorithms using asymptotic (big "O") notation is emphasized. Topics include sorting and searching techniques, basic graph algorithms, and algorithm design techniques. Abstract data types covered include priority queues, dictionaries, disjoint sets, heaps, balanced trees, and hashing. Familiarity with C, Java, and Unix is assumed.
